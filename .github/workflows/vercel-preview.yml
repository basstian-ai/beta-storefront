        # The user specified `vercel --prod`. For PR previews, this usually isn't what you want.
        # A typical preview deployment doesn't use `--prod`.
        # `vercel --yes --token XXXXX` would create a preview deployment.
        # However, I will follow the user's specific instruction to use `--prod`.
        # This might need adjustment if it unintentionally promotes PRs to production.
        run: npx vercel --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --yes
