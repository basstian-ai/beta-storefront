# BFF (Backend for Frontend) Mock Services

This directory contains mock backend-for-frontend functions for fetching data from `dummyjson.com`. These services are intended for development and testing purposes, simulating interactions with a real backend. The BFF now resides under `src/bff` along with client helpers and shared types.

## Directory Structure

- **cms-content/**
  - `index.js`: Fetches CMS content (simulated using dummyjson.com/posts).
- **orders/**
  - `index.js`: Fetches order data (simulated using dummyjson.com/carts).
- **products/**
  - `index.js`: Fetches product data (simulated using dummyjson.com/products).
  - `search.js`: Searches for products by keyword using dummyjson.com.
- **users/**
  - `index.js`: Fetches user data (simulated using dummyjson.com/users).
- **fixtures/**
  - `mock-category-data.json`: Example category and product data used by the BFF (located under `src/fixtures`).
- **helpers/** and **services/**: Shared utilities and server-side services.
- `types.ts`: Shared types for the BFF.

## Services

Each service in its respective subdirectory (e.g., `products`, `users`) exports functions to fetch data. For example, `src/bff/products/index.js` exports a `getProducts` function.

## Utility Functions

- `src/utils/fetchData.ts`: This utility centralizes the logic for making `fetch` requests to `dummyjson.com`. It handles the basic fetch operation, checks for network errors (`response.ok`), parses the JSON response, and returns a typed `FetchResult` object. Services use this utility to reduce code duplication.

## Usage

These services can be imported into your Next.js API routes or other server-side modules. For an example, see `pages/api/bff-test.js`.

## Product Search Endpoint

The BFF defines a **mock** endpoint to search for products by keyword.

```
GET /products/search?q=keyword
```

**Query Parameters**

- `q` (string, required) â€“ the search term.

**Response**

Returns a JSON array of `Product` objects. Each object matches the structure returned from `https://dummyjson.com/products/search`.

This contract allows the frontend to call `/products/search` and receive an array of products that match the given keyword.
